# SAndP_500-Data_Analysis
In this collaborative group project, my peers and I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the performance of 500 prominent companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. We sorted through the S&P 500 data using the FRED API and yfinance API to answer various statistical queries and draw informed conclusions. The notebook containing the code, the files and datasets needed to run the code properly, as well as the presentation deck have been attached.
